Returns sea water density computed by `SeawaterPolynomials.jl` TEOS10 
polynomial approximation from `T` in degrees centigrade, `S` in PSU,  
`P`ressure in bar. This approximation also requires us to approximate
geopotential depth from pressure at 1 m / dbar, and absolute salinity 
as practial salinity.

This method is less accurate than `teos10_density` but will run on GPU.
